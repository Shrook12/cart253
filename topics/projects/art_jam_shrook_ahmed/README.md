## Description

This is a portrait of me. I used the colors I love throughout the project. I created a playful and colorful background with circles that grow over time, with specific areas. My love for playful and colorful art and designs is what inspired me. I also made the color of my hijab (head covering) change when the mouse overlaps, since I wear different colors of hijab, and to show the importance of the hijab to me by adding mouse interaction.
