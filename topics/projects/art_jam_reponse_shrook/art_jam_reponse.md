ART JAM RESPONSE
By Shrook Ahmed

Work#1

First of all, the work is so amazing! I like how there are many things I can interact with in different ways. I can change each element of the face by clicking on it, or change the entire face expression by pressing the space bar, or make the character dizzy by moving the mouse too much. I can even change skin and hair color by clicking on the buttons at the left and on the right. There is so much interactivity! Like every time I thought I knew what I could do by clicking , I discover that I could do something else. The person who did this focused on how to make it as interactive as possible. I also like pixel art. It makes it simpler, but at the same time, more amusing with different facial expressions. His code is also so organized. He has multiple javascript files: one for the eyebrow, one for the eyes, one for the interaction, and one for the mouth and a script where everything is drawn.

Work#2

First, I appreciate how, instead of making a traditional portrait of her, she decided to use the flower of her name to represent herself. I also find that transforming the flower into a brush is a  creative way to express that she likes to paint by using the flower that represents her name, turning it into an art tool. The brush feels satisfying to use, making me want to keep using it. Also, I like how she made some shapes of the flower have a stroke, and some don't. It makes the brush more varied in the visual, and it makes it feel like a blend of multiple brushes in one. I also noticed that when using the brush slowly, it becomes more condensed, and when I go faster. For the code, I think it’s well organized and easy to understand, 
thanks to the comments.

For this one, I love the simplicity, interactivity, and overall design . It’s just so simple and direct: there is a graph and a couple of circles, but the way he incorporated the interaction is amazing and really creative. The center of the graph moves with the mouse, so when the center of the graph touches a circle, there is a reaction, and each circle has a different reaction. Also, the way the circles are positioned gives depth to the design. Instead of making a normal portrait, he used fragments of his own face and put a fragment in a circle to show that there are fragments of ourselves everywhere on digital platforms. The unique reaction for each circle made me curious to explore each of them, and it’s actually really satisfying to engage with it and to look at how it reacts. When I saw the code, there were some functions that were new to me. It seems like it was really hard and challenging. Both the design and the interactivity stand out in this work.
