ART JAM RESPONSE

Work#1

The first game I want to talk about is Looking Fly by Norah Wilcox. When I played this game, I asked myself what makes this game so relaxing. From the moment you start playing, everything is designed and coded to make you feel comfortable and relaxed. The placement of the frog, the art style, and the way the music starts calmly as the game starts, everything works together to make you feel comfortable. These aspects of the game are not only for looks but also to make you feel as if you are a part of the game. As I play, it feels like I am really inside the game, sitting next to the frog. Norah's design matches very well the mood that she wanted the game to have. One thing that makes Looking Fly different is its pacing. Unlike many games that make you want to go faster, Looking Fly has the same calm speed for the whole game. I think that the speed is like this, so the game stays relaxing and not stressful. The way the frog’s tongue works is also interesting. Instead of going where you click, it goes to the place where you clicked before that, which adds difficulty without breaking the calm feeling of the game. Lastly, I was impressed by the code behind Looking Fly. It's  organized, clean, and easy to read, with comments all over the code explaining what it does.

The second one I want to write about is Catcatcat by Pansy. I chose this one because the player is not a frog, which makes it stand out. Having a different theme can make people more curious to play your game. I really like how she uses emojis in her work to make the game look cute and friendly.The game has a fun way to start. When you click on the start screen, the character of the game catches the cat to make the character start the game instead of pressing a button. For the game canvas,it’s a little small, so it was hard to catch the cat. I think making the canvas bigger could help. Also maybe making the canvas shrink gradually  to make it more difficult.In Catcatcat, the player has only one chance to catch the cat. It would be interesting to have different levels of difficulty: an easy level with three chances, a medium level with two chances, and a hard level with one chance. The ending is creative. She uses a speech bubble and an emoji to make the player want to play again. The restart button at the end is also very effective. It makes it easy and quick to play again without going to the start screen.

The third one is Asteroid Shooter, created by Blaize. I also chose this game because it has a different theme from a frog. The experience is so impressive! The moving background and simple shapes make it feel futuristic and easy on the eyes. There is the asteroid speed at the top, which helps the player to know the level they are at and feel more involved in the game. It would be interesting to see the game on a bigger canvas. I think it might make the cool background stand out more. In this game, simple choices like the music, cursor, background, speed, and simplicity of the shape make the experience more engaging.
