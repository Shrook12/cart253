Ideas for mod jam project:

1-Frog is now an alien spaceship at the top of the screen, and the spaceship will take humans instead of flies. And maybe add an enemy if the UFO took it by mistake; you lose. Make the game faster over time as well.

2-Frog becomes an adventurer in a desert. The adventurer has to take as many treasures as possible, but he has to be careful because there might be a poisonous treasure.

3-Frog becomes a little girl who wants to take as many flowers as possible, but she has to be careful because there might be dangerous plants.

4-Frogs become fish in waters that try to hunt for food. He has to take as much food as possible while trying to stay away from plastic, or he will die:(.

5-Frog becomes an artist with a brush and paint instead of flies. The artist has to use the brush to collect the paint, but every time he misses, he will have less paint and won't be able to complete his work.

6-Frog becomes a boxer who tries to punch his enemy. He has to punch his enemy a certain number of times before he gets tired, or else he will lose.

7- A dragon who tries to burn evil monsters, but it might get confusing because some kind monsters will resemble the evil ones, and the game will go faster.

8-A human tries to catch the bus. And every time he misses a bus, he will be late for his job and will lose after three times missing the bus. SO HE HAS TO CATCH IT!

9- Same logic as the one before, but with a different story. An alien who has lost his UFO on Earth. He has to catch his UFO back before humans notice that there is an alien on Earth. If he misses three UFOs, you lose!:)

10- An ice cream running away from a little girl, and she tries to get her ice cream before it melts, and you lose! I have to make it really hard for the little girl to get it back.

11- Someone in winter, trying to catch enough money to get a jacket. If he was not able to catch enough money, he would die of cold, so you lose. 

12- Why not make something with two players? A player at the bottom and one at the top. Maybe soccer? The player at the bottom is an attacker, and the one at the top is a guardian. When the attacker's leg touches the ball, the ball will go to the top, and the guardian needs to prevent it from passing. But since I don't really like soccer... I would prefer to find another idea similar, but with another story!:)

13-Let's go back to an alien storyðŸ˜…. A battle between aliens and humans. Who will win? Player 1: an alien UFO at the bottom, player 2 a human spaceship at the top, with Earth also at the top. When an alien UFO touches a meteorite, the human spaceship will have to protect the Earth. If a meteorite passes more than three times before time ends, Earth is destroyed, and player 2 loses.

14-There is a player 1 at the bottom and a player 2 at the top. Both of them are cats, and each of them will try to get as much cat food (the fly) as possible, and who have more food will win!:)

15-Another idea with a cat trying to catch its toy. So the cat at the bottom and the toy will come to random places from the top, and the cat will need to catch it with his hand.

16-Why not make the fly a player two and let player two have control over the fly, but with certain limits? I don't know if this is a good idea. But maybe, for example, the frog will become a police officer(player one), and the fly will be a thief(player 2). The police officer will try to catch the thief. If he catches him, the police officer will lose, and if he doesn't catch him before the end of time, the thief will win. The thief can only go either up, right, left,bottom. Maybe there will be obstacles?

17-Why not make the fly the one who catches the frog? Maybe the fly is a flower that is trying to catch a cup of water(frog). Player one water at the bottom will just move water right and left, so the flower doesn't get the water. If player two flower able to get water, then he wins; else player one wins. 

18-Or making both the frog and the fly try catching each other? For example, maybe a hunter(frog) and a tiger(fly), and each time one gets touched by the other, it will affect the life span. After being touched three times, you lose.

But I want something more imaginary.

19-Maybe the same idea as 18, but creating my own creature?

20-Something with a mummy? The mummy(the frog, player1) will try to catch a human(the fly, player2). If the mummy catches the human, then the mummy wins. If the humans were able to avoid the mummy, then the humans win.
