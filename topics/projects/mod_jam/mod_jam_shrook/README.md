## Description


Reversed Space is a game where nothing makes sense. Humans float in space, hoping to be abducted by aliens. Aliens compete eachother to abduct as many humans as possible. Humans are happy when they get abducted.

There are two players(aliens):
One at the top : Use the arrow keys. The controls are reversed! Left goes right and right goes left. Press the up arrow key to extend your alien hand and abduct humans.

For the bottom player: Use the mouse or trackpad. The controls are also reversed. Move left to go right and right to go left . Click extend your alien hand to abduct a humans.

Whoever abducts the most humans wins. 

BE CAREFUL!The timer might act weird at a certain time!
